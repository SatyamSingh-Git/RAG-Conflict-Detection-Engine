## MRI Installation Project — Status: DELAYED / NON-OPERATIONAL

### Current Status
The new MRI machine installation remains incomplete as of March 20, 2026. The system is CURRENTLY NON-OPERATIONAL due to the following unresolved issues:

### Issue 1: Gradient Coil Defect
During the final calibration phase on February 25, the primary gradient coil was found to have a manufacturing defect that produces unacceptable image artifacts at field strengths above 2.0T. The defective component was shipped back to the manufacturer (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) on March 2. We are awaiting a replacement coil, which has an estimated delivery date of April 18-25, 2026.

### Issue 2: RF Shielding Failure
The radiofrequency shielding in Suite MRI-2 failed the electromagnetic compatibility test on March 8. External RF interference from the new cell tower installed on the hospital roof in January 2026 is causing significant image degradation. A specialized RF shielding contractor (MagShield Inc.) has been engaged and is scheduled to complete remediation work by April 5, 2026.

### Issue 3: Helium Supply Chain
The cryogenic helium supply required for the superconducting magnet has been impacted by global supply chain disruptions. Our current helium reserve will last approximately 6 weeks, but we require a guaranteed continuous supply before committing to full operation.

### Patient Impact
All MRI appointments are being redirected to the OLD 1.5T scanner (Siemens Aera), which is currently operating at 130% of its recommended duty cycle. This is causing accelerated wear on the old machine, and we have already experienced two unplanned shutdowns (March 5 and March 12) requiring emergency service calls totaling $8,400.

### Financial Impact
The installation delays have resulted in approximately $127,000 in additional costs including contractor overtime, temporary scanner rental fees, and patient referral costs to external facilities. Additionally, the manufacturer's warranty clock starts ticking upon delivery, meaning we are losing warranty coverage days without operational benefit.

### Projected Timeline
Optimistic: Full operation by May 1, 2026
Realistic: Full operation by May 15, 2026
Pessimistic: Full operation by June 1, 2026
