# Night Shift Supervisor Log — Multiple Entries
**Author:** Sarah Chen, Night Shift Supervisor
**Dates:** January 15 - March 15, 2026

## January 15, 2026 — CRITICAL STAFFING SHORTAGE
Night shift began with only 12 of 19 required nursing staff present. Three nurses called in sick, two positions remain unfilled despite HR's claim of 100% staffing, and two nurses were pulled to cover the Emergency Department. Mandatory overtime was initiated for 5 staff members from the evening shift, resulting in 16-hour shifts for these individuals.

Ward 3B operated with a nurse-to-patient ratio of 1:9, well above the safe threshold of 1:5 for acute medical patients. One medication error occurred (wrong dose of heparin) that was caught by pharmacy before administration.

## January 28, 2026 — RESIGNATION CLUSTER
Three experienced night shift nurses (combined 34 years of experience) submitted resignation notices today, effective February 28. All three cited unsustainable workload, mandatory overtime, and concerns about patient safety as their primary reasons for leaving. This will increase our staffing deficit to 5 unfilled positions on nights.

## February 10, 2026 — UNSAFE CONDITIONS
Severe nursing shortages again tonight. 11 of 19 positions staffed. Called the nursing supervisor for help; was told no agency nurses are authorized per HR directive. Two patient falls occurred on Ward 2A (one resulting in a hip fracture requiring surgical intervention). Contributing factor was inadequate rounding due to staffing levels.

Staff morale is critically low. The break room whiteboard has been filled with anonymous complaints about workload and management's disconnect from floor conditions. I have filed a formal safe harbor declaration for tonight's shift.

## February 25, 2026 — CONTINUED DETERIORATION
Mandatory overtime has been required on 18 of 25 night shifts this month. Three more nurses have begun interviewing at competing hospitals. The ward clerk reported overhearing multiple nurses discussing "quiet quitting" — doing the minimum required rather than going above and beyond.

## March 15, 2026 — FORMAL COMPLAINT
I am formally documenting that night shift staffing levels have been critically unsafe for the majority of Q1 2026. Despite repeated escalations to HR and nursing administration, conditions have not improved. The claim that we are "100% staffed" does not reflect the reality on the floor. I am requesting that this log be entered into the official quality and safety record.
