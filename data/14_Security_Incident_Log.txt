NOTABLE IMPROVEMENT:
The new visitor management system (implemented January 2026) has reduced unauthorized access incidents by 62%. All visitors now receive photo ID badges that expire at the end of their visit. The system has also aided law enforcement in one active investigation.

NEW BODY-WORN CAMERA PROGRAM:
Body-worn cameras were deployed to all security officers on February 1. In the first two months, footage was requested for 6 incident investigations and proved instrumental in resolving 4 of them, including 2 workplace violence complaints.
